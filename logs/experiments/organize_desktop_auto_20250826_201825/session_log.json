      "robot_reasoning": "The image shows a desktop with various items such as a keyboard, a computer mouse, a pen, a reusable water bottle, a notebook, and what appears to be a smartphone. These items suggest a mix of work-related tools and personal accessories. Given this mix, it's important to understand how the user prefers to organize these items. Asking about their overall organization principles will help establish whether they prefer functional zones (e.g., tools on one side, personal items on the other) or a more integrated layout. This understanding will guide the organization process effectively.",

Understanding your preference will help me organize the desktop in a way that aligns with your workflow and aesthetic preferences.",
