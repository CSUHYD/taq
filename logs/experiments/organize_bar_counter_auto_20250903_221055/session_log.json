I will choose the first item from the list, which is the plate. No applicable rule exists for it in the User Preferences JSON, so I will propose a general action to place it somewhere. I will ask: 'Should I place the black plate with a white bird pattern on the bar counter?' This question is designed to gather a fact about where to place the plate, which I can then use to start forming a rule."
